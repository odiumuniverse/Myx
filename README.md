## Install

```bash
# Arch (AUR)
yay -S myx

# macOS / Linux (Homebrew)
brew install HaseebKhalid1507/homebrew-tap/myx

# Cargo (all platforms — Linux, macOS, Windows)
cargo install myx

# Prebuilt binary (Linux x86_64, macOS)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/HaseebKhalid1507/Myx/releases/latest/download/myx-installer.sh | sh
```

On **Windows**, install [Rust](https://rustup.rs) first, then `cargo install myx` in
PowerShell. Set `MYX_CLIENT_ID` as an environment variable or place your client ID in
`%USERPROFILE%\.config\myx\client_id`.

Or grab a `.deb` / archive from [Releases](https://github.com/HaseebKhalid1507/Myx/releases),
or build from source: `cargo install --path .`.

## Get started

You need a free Spotify app client ID (one minute):

1. [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard), then **Create app**
2. Add the redirect URI `http://127.0.0.1:8989/login`
3. Copy the **Client ID** and set it:

```bash
export MYX_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
```

Then run:

```bash
myx
```

First launch opens your browser to log in (OAuth PKCE, no secret needed). Then
browse with `↑↓` and hit `⏎` to play. After that, just `myx`.

## Keys

```
⇥ / [ ]    switch section        ← →      switch view
↑↓ / j k   move                  ⏎        play / open
⇧ ⏎        play the highlighted album, playlist or artist
/          search                a        actions
space      play · pause          n / b    next · prev
⇧ ← →      seek                  s        shuffle
+ / -      volume                R        repeat
o          sort                  r        reload
z          hide sidebar          q        quit
```

Media keys (Play/Pause, Stop, Next, Prev, Volume) work when the terminal is
focused. Mouse works too: click tabs, click a track, double-click to play.

Holding `⇧ ←` / `⇧ →` scrubs continuously and commits one seek when you let go.
`⇧ ⏎` needs a terminal that reports modified Enter (kitty, WezTerm, foot); `P`
does the same everywhere.

Inside tmux, add `set -g focus-events on` to `~/.tmux.conf` so album art is
re-sent the moment you switch back to myx's window.

## Config

Optional, at `~/.config/myx/config.toml`. Every key has a default, so you only
write the ones you want to change:

```toml
# Rows kept visible above and below the cursor before the list scrolls.
scrolloff = 3

# Spotify app client id. MYX_CLIENT_ID overrides this if it is set.
client_id = "your-client-id"
```
